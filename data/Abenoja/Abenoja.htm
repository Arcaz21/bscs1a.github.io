    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a very hard working dedicated person and I live life to it’s fullest. I laugh often and am very optimistic. I think my smile is contagious (^^).</p>
    <h2>"The First Half of My ‘Kinabuhing USePian"</h2>
    <p>I felt the nostalgia when I rode via Metro Shuttle bus. Leaving from home and exploring your own dreams are a very important part of maturing. For some, the physical separation from home is a difficult transition to college life. During the onset of the first half of classes in USeP, I was still worried, somewhat, of the step I was going to have to make in regards to the quality of work that I was going to have to do in order to pass with decent grades. In high school I had made procrastination an immense part of my life. It continued throughout the semester and found myself in deep voids that were extremely stressful. 
	<p>Not only did the schoolwork affect my life, but my personal life was affected as well. My addiction to computer games had almost been a year before I made my way to college. Another thing that I realized is that privacy is always available at home. There is always somewhere to read, write, listen to music, or to just rest. Dorm life is a harsh reality to college; it’s life-changing to me especially that I’m a neophyte. 
	<p>Demanding teachers, out-of-this-world exams, and frantic schedules. Everything is putting weight to my pressure. And as a freshman, adjustments to these are hard to achieve. Satan is seducing me to partake the forbidden fruit of sin. But all of these experiences with the first semester in the University, I experienced to be difficult with regards to maintain of my passing grade even though it cost my allowance. And I learned to adjust the future events of my life. And hopefully, it will lead my feet to the right path towards success. </p>

    <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <p>My achievements are the best moments in my life. Each of my achievement has signified that I have accomplished something. That accomplishment has made the people around me proud especially my parents. My achievements have made me the person I am today and they form an integral part of my life even if I merely have memories of them.</p>
    <p>I wasn’t very good with chess, which were the most common indoor games that I've played. However, I was more of an outdoor game person. I used to play Lawn Tennis and Basketball. In off-campus activities had joined campus journalism in my school, regional and national levels as a cartoonist.</p>
    <p>My achievements have indeed made me the person I am today. Some of these achievements have been rewarded to me in the form of mementos and some of these achievements have been rewarded to me in the form of personal satisfaction. I used to feel personally satisfied from the fulfilling social work that I did during my spare time. My achievements are an indispensable part of my life and they are the ones I will cherish forever.</p>
